# RS4852CANverter

**RS4852CANverter** is an open-source project that facilitates the conversion of RS485 signals to CAN signals, enabling interoperability between devices using these communication protocols. The project includes both the hardware and the software required for the converter.

## Description

This converter is designed to provide a flexible and modular solution for integrating RS485 devices into CAN networks. Key advantages include:
- Fast and simple interfacing between different protocol networks
- High configurability through source code modifications and circuit adjustments
- Expandability and adaptability for specific applications

## Features

- **RS485 â†” CAN Conversion:** Enables data transmission and reception between RS485 devices and CAN networks.
- **Modular Design:** The code is structured for easy customization and functionality expansion.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Microcontroller:** For example, Arduino, STM32, or another compatible platform (specify the model used).
- **RS485 Transceiver:** For example, MAX485.
- **CAN Transceiver:** For example, MCP2551, TJA1050, or another compatible model.
- **Additional Components:** Resistors, capacitors, and other passive elements as per the circuit schematic.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure a voltage source compliant with the microcontroller and transceiver specifications.

> **Note:** Refer to the included electrical schematic for complete details on connections and component values.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndreiCatanoiu/RS4852CANverter.git
   ```

2. **Open the project:**

   Open the project in your preferred development environment (e.g., Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, etc.).

3. **Configure parameters:**

   Check and, if necessary, modify the configuration file (e.g., `config.h` or another settings file) to adjust baud rates, addresses, and other parameters specific to your application.

4. **Connect hardware:**

   Connect components according to the circuit schematic provided in the `schematics` directory (or another relevant directory). Ensure all connections are properly made before powering up.

## Usage
